        tags are composed of an opening tag, content and a closing tag.
        <br> <b> &lt;name&gt;   content   &lt; / name &gt; </b> <br> 
        void tags have no content and therefore don't need a closing tag.

            <b>HTML</b> files are the structure of web pages, while <b>CSS</b> are what dictates what the pages look like.
            <br><b>Javascript</b> are the components that change the elements of the <b>HTML</b>. It is important to structure a web page because it becomes much easier to read and to alter the code later.
            When making your own web page, it's a good idea to look at other people's code in order to better understand how to write your own code.

          </p>
          <p>
            The <b>HTML DOM</b> model is constructed as a tree of objects. It turns tags and content into elements in the tree.
            All of the elements in a web page are boxes. When designing a web page from a template, the easiest way to start is by dividing all of the items into boxes. It is important to start with the biggest boxes and then proceed to the smaller ones.

                <span class="titles"><b>Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</b></span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Cascading Style sheets define the formatting (style) to be applied to the <b>HTML</b>. These properties can be applied to both individual elements as well as to its descendants. <b>CSS</b> can be called from the <b>HTML</b> page itself or from its own seperate file. It is ideal to write <b>CSS</b> code on a separate file.

              </p>
              <p>
                ID's and classes mark elements in order to change their characteristics in CSS. While classes refer to multiple elements, ID's refer to unique elements. Headings like <em>h1</em> and <em>h2</em> also help avoid to repetition by allowing you to change multiple elemets using <b>CSS</b>. I used <b>CSS</b> on this webpage. Since the white rectangles that surround this text all needed to be the same, I assigned them a class element. Then in the <b>CSS</b> file I only needed to apply the style to the class name instead of changing every rectangle one by one inside the <b>HTML</b> file.

              </p>
              <p>
                <b>HTML</b> elements are boxes and each box has 4 components; content, padding, border and margin. It is difficult to fit all of these boxes together on a web page. There are two ways for dealing with this issue. The first is to set the sizes in terms of a percentage. The second option is to set the <em>box-sizing</em> attribute to <em>border-box</em> for every element. In order to have two boxes next to each other, it is necessary to add <em>display:flex;</em> to your <b>CSS</b> code.
